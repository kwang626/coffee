				<h1>SodoI Coffee Tasting House</h1>
				<h4>
					Like many endeavors, the genesis of Sodoi spans back centuries. Jae Chung, Bob Baldwin, and Robert Hensley have nearly 100 years of combined experience in coffee trading, roasting, blending and serving. In addition, their mentors have passed knowledge gained from a lifetime in the coffee industry. Sodoi stands firmly on a foundation of 200 years combined industry expertise. Bob and Robert have been honored to call Alfred Peet (founder of Peetâ€™s Coffee & Tea) a mentor and friend. In addition to acquiring the vast knowledge and experience by working with Mr. Peet, Bob and Robert worked for Probat Burns, a German roasting company founded in 1864. These past masters of the art and science of coffee include dedicated professionals across the full spectrum of producing great coffee. </h4>
