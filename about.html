	<h4>Kevin drinks a lot of coffee. Like, unhealthy amounts of coffee. Caffiene is all that keeps Kevin going in his weekly all-nighters in the depths of Soda Hall. So, Kevin decided to make this website about some of his favorite coffee shops in the Berkeley area. Kevin's current favorite coffee shop is Philz's Coffee, and his favorite drink is the Gingersnap Iced Coffee.  All assets and materials used on this website belong to their rightful owners.</h4>
